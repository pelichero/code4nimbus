## Introduction

In this repository, we aim to provide a structured and hands-on approach to learning Clojure, Docker, and Kafka. Our primary focus is on practical knowledge, and each technology has its dedicated space within the repository.

## Technologies

### Clojure

[Clojure](https://clojure.org/) is a dynamic, functional programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It emphasizes simplicity, immutability, and functional programming principles. 

### Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers allow you to package an application and its dependencies together in a consistent environment.

### Kafka

[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It provides high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable publish-subscribe messaging.

## Getting Started

To begin your learning journey with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the technology-specific folders to find tutorials, code examples, and resources.
3. Follow the study path plan outlined in the repository to progress systematically.
4. Feel free to experiment, modify code, and create your exercises as you learn.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `/clojure`: Contains Clojure study materials, exercises, and projects.
- `/docker`: Includes Docker-related tutorials, code samples, and projects.
- `/kafka`: Consists of Kafka-based learning resources, hands-on examples, and projects.
- `/resources`: This folder holds shared resources, books, and references for all three technologies.
