Welcome to my monorepo project dedicated to exploring Clojure and Datomic while leveraging Docker and Kafka technologies. This repository documents my study path and progress as I delve into these exciting areas of software development.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- `clojure-basics`: Contains introductory exercises and code snippets for learning Clojure programming.
- `datomic-integration`: Explores integrating Datomic, a powerful database system, into Clojure applications.
- `docker-environment`: Provides Docker configurations for setting up development environments, including necessary dependencies.
- `kafka-integration`: Covers using Kafka for building event-driven architectures and connecting it with Clojure applications.

## Study Path

1. **Getting Started with Clojure**
   - Explore basic syntax and functional programming concepts.
   - Implement small coding exercises to solidify understanding.

2. **Diving into Datomic**
   - Study Datomic's data model and architecture.
   - Set up a sample Datomic database and interact with it from a Clojure application.

3. **Working with Docker**
   - Learn Docker fundamentals and containerization concepts.
   - Create Dockerfiles for Clojure applications and Datomic instances.

4. **Building with Kafka**
   - Understand the principles of event streaming and Kafka.
   - Develop a simple event producer/consumer system using Kafka and Clojure.

5. **Integration and Projects**
   - Combine knowledge gained from previous steps to build more complex applications.
   - Experiment with connecting Clojure applications to Datomic using Dockerized environments.
   - Explore advanced Kafka scenarios in Clojure-based microservices.
